    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my first ever portfolio that I have created with HTML. I am a recent UCF graduate obtaining an Accounting BA with a minor in leadership studies. I have had numerous accounting internships with companies like Amazon, The Walt Disney Company, Marriott and many more. I have received three full time offers before I graduated in May 2020. I accepted a full time offer at a top four accounting firm, Ernest and Young, as a Risk Advisor set to start July 2020.  </p>
    <p> Covid-19 has affected many people around the world. Due to Covid-19 my Disney internship ended two months earlier then expected. I was blessed with the opportunity to take a boot-camp style course to learn jr. web development skills. Stay tuned in order to see how my skills progress throughout this seven-week course. </p>
